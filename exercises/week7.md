# Week 7 Exercises

Exercises designed by Josh Archibald for the section of [week 7 of CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/fall/weeks/7).

Exercises can be completed using CS50 Codespaces.

## Getting started

To get the distribution code, run:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsarchibald/cs50/2022/fall/exercises/distro/cabbages.zip
```

```
unzip cabbages.zip
```

```
rm -f cabbages.zip
```

Go ahead and open the `cabbages` directory in CS50 Labs view.

As a useful exercise, run the following in your terminal:

```
ls
```

You'll see that the `cabbages` directory contains many different files, including these instructions (`README.md`), a bunch of `.sql` files (which you will fill with your code), a file called `cabbages.db` (which will become a SQLite database), and `simulate.py`, which is a fun utility I wrote for your use later in this problem.
