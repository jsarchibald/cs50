Contact Josh at [jarchibald@college.harvard.edu](mailto:jarchibald@college.harvard.edu).

Section materials will be posted each week - check back for more!

Note that sections are numbered in accordance with weeks in the course - so the first section is called week 1!

## Links

I'll be keeping track of any links I keep in the notes of my slides, or send over Zoom chat, in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5C8vEXpc8TtMHB_-lhn7GhKdQ5sCWuy0xGD3owDYA4/edit?usp=sharing). These are in order of appearance in the class.

## Design help

I wrote up a sheet with some guiding questions and general advice for code design -- check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZGa4rA5xN-Fwb0SgTW0JX4m93R4ksHKx/view?usp=sharing). This isn't an exhaustive list, and much of design is subjective, but this is a good place to start until you get more experience and intuition.
