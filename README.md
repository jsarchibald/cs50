# CS50 - Fall 2022
Lab materials for Josh Archibald's fall 2022 lab of Harvard's CS50.

Contact Josh at [jarchibald@college.harvard.edu](mailto:jarchibald@college.harvard.edu).

Lab materials will be posted each week - check back for more!

Note that labs are numbered in accordance with weeks in the course - so the first lab as a group is called week 2, since we first met in week 2!


## Design help

I wrote up a sheet with some guiding questions and general advice for code design -- check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZGa4rA5xN-Fwb0SgTW0JX4m93R4ksHKx/view?usp=sharing). This isn't an exhaustive list, and much of design is subjective, but this is a good place to start until you get more experience and intuition.
